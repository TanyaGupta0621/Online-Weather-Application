A weather app is an online real-time application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to make calls to a RESTful API to return the current weather data. Users can also update their location and search for weather forecasts. Additionally, users can search for sunrise and sunset times.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
